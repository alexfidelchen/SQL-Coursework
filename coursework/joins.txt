SQL JOINING TABLES

- Suppose we have two tables: Active Customers and Reward Customers. 
	- Active Customers has the columns customer_id and fav_color while 
	Reward Customers has columns customer_id and num_purchases (number
	of purchases. You can cannot combine the two tables by the customer_id 
	column. 
	
- You can also connect tables together using the JOIN clause. 	
*** The JOIN clause connects two tables together by connecting
	a column from each table together. When you connect two columns
	together, a new column is made. 
		Syntax:
			SELECT [tableName.column1], [tableName.column2],... [tableName.columnX]
			FROM [table1] 
			[Join type] [table2] ON [column1] = [column2]
		
*** When you connect two tables together using JOIN, ALL ELEMENTS, FROM 
	BOTH TABLES, ARE COMBINED. However, only mutual elements will be included
	in the new table. Elements in one table but not the other WILL BE THROWN OUT.
	To avoid this, use another type of join. 
	
	- When you connect tables together using LEFT JOIN, all the elements 
	in the left table will be in the new column, left and right column determined
	by its side of the JOIN clause. 
	
		*** Assuming not the left and right columns do not have all the same elements, 
		the new column will have elements which  are not associated with elements
		in other columns, so some of the new column's elements will be associated with NULL. 
	
		- LEFT JOIN is helpful when you want to determine which users 
		have spent money on their accounts and which have not. 
		- ON is a clause?
		
*** If you chain multiple JOIN clauses in FROM, the tables are connected
	sequentailly (in order), a table joins with table from first JOIN, then
	the table from the second JOIN. 
	
- You do NOT have connect two tables together by the existing columns, 
	you may also connect two tables together by created columns from 
	one table. So instead of connecting a table by table.test1, you can 
	connect to table one by left(table.test1,7). 

*** You can connect two tables together by ANY columns from each table. 
	They do NOT have to have the same name. Just be aware that if the 
	two columns don't have many mutual elements, your column is going to 
	be a lot smaller.
