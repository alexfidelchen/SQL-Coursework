SQL FUNCTIONS 
 
	
*** The LEFT() function shortens a column's elements to a certain
	number of characters, starting from the left. 
	syntax: left([column you want shortened elements in], 
	[number of characters you want to shorten the element to])
	
	- The LEFT() function allows you to shorten elements so 
	organize them into more general groups. Good to use when 
	you want to group rentals by month, your data has month, 
	year and day. 
	
- The MIN() function gives you the row's smallest or earliest element
	in a column. As expected, the MAX() function gives the largest or latest element 
	in a column. If used with group by, MIN() and MAX() finds the smallest 
	or largest elements in their group. 
	
- The DISTINCT keyword returns column's elements such that no 
	element repeats itself. 

- DATEDIFF() returns the number of days between one date to the 
	other. DATEDIFF() includes ending day, but not the beginning
	day. DATEDIFF() only available in MySQL.
	
- PERIOD_DIFF returns the months between one month to another. 
	Last month is included. Again, only available in MySQL. 
		- syntax: SELECT PERIOD_DIFF(YYMM, YYMM). YY is short for 
		the year in two numbers. MM is short for the month in two 
		numbers. 
		
- DATE_FORMAT() formats a date so it can be used in DATEDIFF() or 
	PERIOD_DIFF().
		- syntax: DATE_FORMAT(date,format). See MySQL Date and 
		Time Functions documentation for details.
