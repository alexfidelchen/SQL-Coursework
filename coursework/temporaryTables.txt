SQL TEMPORARY TABLES 

*** A temporary table is a table created by the user. Temporary tables allow
	you to create tables with the information you want and query off of it. 
	
- Notice that when you query a database you create a table. That table is 
	a temporary table. You can save that temporary table using the following 
	syntax.
		- syntax: drop temporary table if exists [temporary table name];
		(DON'T FORGET THE SEMICOLON)
			create temporary table [temp table name]
			SELECT 
			FROM 
			WHERE
			
		- You only need to include the drop table statement if you ran 
		the SELECT FORM WHERE query already. 
		
- If you're using temporary tables, make sure your column nicknames are 
	single words because column nicknames have to be single words for you 
	to reference them. 
	
- You can still refer to your columns using the original name.

- To decide to give a nickname to your column, it shouldn't be the same
	name as your table.  

*** Temporary tables are deleted when you close HeidiSQL.
