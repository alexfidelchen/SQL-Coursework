SQL ARITHMETIC

- Revenue = Price of product * number of products sold

*** You can do basic arithmetic in SQL (addition, subtraction, etc...)

- You can nickname columns in the SELECT clause using the "as" keyword. 
	syntax: [column name] as "[new column name]" 
	Remember, these column names are nicknames so you can't use them
	for arithmetic. 
	
- You can multiply two columns' elements together with the "*" sign.
	- Each element in one column with its corresponding element 
	in another column. 
	
- The SUM() function adds up and returns all the elements in a
	column. You can group the sum by using GROUP BY. For example, 
	lets say I have a column which represents how much money a 
	trio of brothers spent at the casino. I could add up that 
	money using SUM(), then use GROUP BY to group the money by 
	brother and see which brother spent the most money. 
	
- Remember, count() returns the number of elements in a column, SUM() adds them 
	all up.
