SQL CONNECTING TABLES

- What if you wanted to get information from two different tables. 

- When you're dealing with multiple tables, you have to
	to specify which table a catagory is from. You do this with
	dot notation. 
	
*** You can connect two tables together by connecting two columns
		the tables have in common. To do this, you can either use
		the JOIN clause (action) or use the WHERE clause and set
		the mutual catagories together. 
		
*** Note that all when connect two columns together, only the 
	mutual elements are in the column. Elements that belong to 
	one column but not the other GET THROWN OUT. This could happen
	if one column had more ids than the other. 

- You use the AND clause to connect two expressions together?

-  To connect two categories together, use the WHERE clause, 
	as expected, then the AND clause. 
	syntax: WHERE [first connector] AND [second connector]
	
- To reference catagories in SELECT and WHERE, you have to 
	reference them in FROM. 
	
- If you want to use a catagory in SELECT and WHERE, that 
	catagory's table has to be in the FROM clause. 
	
- WHERE's expressions do NOT need to be all on one line. 

*** The expressions can get really long so you can set the tables 
	to variables shorten the expresions. To set a variable to a
	table,write the table name then set the variable you want to 
	set it to immediately after it. You do NOT need to declare the 
	variable before using it. 
	syntax: [table name] [variable name]
	It's recommended to use a one or two letter variable. 
	

*** If you set the table to a variable, you have to use the variable
	throughout the SQL file, you CANNOT use the actual table name 
	again. 
	
- If a column name is unique, you don't have to specify which 
	table it's from. 
	
*** It makes how which columns you connect tables by, because its 
	possible to get wildly different answers.
